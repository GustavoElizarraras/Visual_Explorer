Proclaiming that the main, most dangerous part of the war is already in the past; President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said on Thursday that his office was in constant communication with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to sustain a truce in eastern Ukraine, and that Ukraine was now looking ahead to pursue membership in the European Union.

Speaking at a news conference in Kiev, the capital, Mr. Poroshenko said that he planned to meet with Mr. Putin within the next three weeks and expressed confidence that the cease-fire with pro-Russian rebels would hold.

At the same time, Mr. Poroshenko voiced several positions certain to irk the Kremlin, which has worked aggressively to prevent Ukraine from shifting politically and economically toward Europe.
